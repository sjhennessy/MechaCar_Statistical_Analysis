## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

library(dplyr)
MechaCar_mpg <- read.csv('MechaCar_mpg.csv',stringsAsFactors = F) #read in dataset
head(MechaCar_mpg)

lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD,data=MechaCar_mpg) #generate multiple linear regression model

summary(lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD,data=MechaCar_mpg)) #generate summary statistics
